									<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
									<ul>
										<p>
											This collection of projects have been an enabler 
											for my programming skills. The process of developing 
											something from scratch is something which I have an 
											extreme affinity towards and I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity 
											to learn and growth through their development.

											<h3>Heart Disease Analysis</h3>
												<h4>Purpose<h4>
										</header>
								<ul>
									<p>
										To conduct an analysis on a dataset of particular interest, as well as delve deeper into the understanding
										the importance of the variables within the dataset; the relationships they have with one another, and ultimately the variables which 
										play the most significant role in the outcome of the predictive model.
										<br>
										<h4>Outcome</h4>
										The project enlightened me on the procedure of analysis and what to look for outside of just building a predictive model. 
										I learnt of the importance of identifying key variables subject to the outcome, allowing for more effective insights to be 
										pulled from the dataset.

													<h3>Olympics Dashboard</h3>
														<h4>Purpose</h4>
												</header>
			
												<ul>
													<p>
														This project was designed to explore the power of utilising both Dash and Plotly to create a dashboard 
														capable of providing basic insights into various events related to track and field over the history of the Olympic games.
														<br>
														<h4>Outcome</h4>
														My scope of knowledge with regards to the building of analytical dashboards was greatly developed. 
														I look forward to the prospect of building dashboards not only leveraging the power of Dash and Plotly,
														but utilising a variety of new technologies to continuously develop my skills of dashboard development.

								<h3>Evader Game<h3>
										<h4>Purpose<h4>
							</header>
						<ul> 
								<p>
									To obtain a sound understanding of the process of developing an application in Java.
									I wished to expand the scope of my knowledge by taking on a challenge which I had no experience in, 
									this was to build a basic game which would explore many of the key principles of the language. 
									This project was the culmination of learning the language attemping to leverage Java to
									exhibit a tangible represetation of my progress. 
									<h4>Outcome</h4>
									My eyes were opened by the potential which Java has to build unique and creative applications.
									I learnt the key aspects of developing a program with Java and became very familiar with the manner 
									in which the language communicates with various classes through objects and methods.
