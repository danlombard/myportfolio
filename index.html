									<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
									<ul>
										<p>
											This collection of projects have been an enabler 
											for my programming skills. The process of developing 
											something from scratch is something which I have an 
											extreme affinity towards and I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity 
											to learn and grow through their development.

											<h3>Geospatial Analysis of South African Crime</h3>
												<h4>Purpose<h4>
										</header>
								<ul>
									<p>
										To gain insight on the prominence of crime activities subject to the different provinces of South Africa. This is a project close to 
										home, due to the simple fact that whilst being on my gap year in Australia I have been shocked at the amount of horrible things happening 
										in my communities back home in South Africa. The project provides an eye opening representation of the severity of the issues we face as 
										South Africans with regards to crime. 
										<br>
										<h4>Outcome</h4>
										<p>The steps required to complete this project demanded a number of very important skills, starting with data 
											collection by means of a tailored webscrapper built in Python. The geospatial data then needed to be fine tuned and prepared for analysis, which was conducted
											in a googlessheet allowing for simple reading of the dataset via R's googlessheet library.
										 The visualisation dashboard was built using Shiny, providing a wide variety of approaches to visualise the data to the user. The structure of the 
										application provides insight into the arrchitecture of how any basic application works in order to serve it's purpose, by adopting the structure of global
									 functions, backend server and frontend ui. </p>

											<h3>Student Database Management System</h3>
												<h4>Purpose<h4>
										</header>
								<ul>
									<p>
										To obtain a solution to a problem identified within my duties as a gap student in a Boarding house.
										I felt there was a necessity to gain a deeper insight into the academic struggles of our senior boarders 
										heading into the exam preparation period. The initial database system was to merely add student data to a database.
										I then tailored the database to accommodate for our boarders, by identifying which subjects they had the least confidence in 
										going into the exam preparation period. This allows us as a boarding staff to ensure that the optimal resources are provided to the boarders
										in the form of tutors whom have high compentency in the subject matter which our boarders struggle with the most.
										<br>
										<h4>Outcome</h4>
										<p>Not only do I feel that this was a great initiative to add value to my role as a gap student, but I believe this has been a tremendous 
											learning experience. I have developed information systems leveraging tools such as SQL server and Visual Studio in the past, but this was
										fresh take with SQLite and Python, providing me with a new perspective in working with data. I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to take on this new challenge.</p>

											<h3>Heart Disease Analysis</h3>
												<h4>Purpose<h4>
										</header>
								<ul>
									<p>
										To conduct an analysis on a dataset of particular interest, as well as delve deeper into the understanding
										the importance of the variables within the dataset; the relationships they have with one another, and ultimately the variables which 
										play the most significant role in the outcome of the predictive model.
										<br>
										<h4>Outcome</h4>
										<p>The project enlightened me on the procedure of analysis and what to look for outside of just building a predictive model. 
											I learnt of the importance of identifying key variables subject to the outcome, allowing for more effective insights to be 
											pulled from the dataset.</p>

													<h3>Olympics Dashboard</h3>
														<h4>Purpose</h4>
												</header>
			
												<ul>
													<p>
														This project was designed to explore the power of utilising both Dash and Plotly to create a dashboard 
														capable of providing basic insights into various events related to track and field over the history of the Olympic games.
														<br>
														<h4>Outcome</h4>
														<p>
															My scope of knowledge with regards to the building of analytical dashboards was greatly developed. 
														I look forward to the prospect of building dashboards not only leveraging the power of Dash and Plotly,
														but utilising a variety of new technologies to continuously develop my skills of dashboard development.

								<h3>Evader Game<h3>
										<h4>Purpose<h4>
							</header>
						<ul> 
								<p>
									To obtain a sound understanding of the process of developing an application in Java.
									I wished to expand the scope of my knowledge by taking on a challenge which I had no experience in, 
									this was to build a basic game which would explore many of the key principles of the language. 
									This project was the culmination of learning the language attemping to leverage Java to
									exhibit a tangible represetation of my progress. 
									<h4>Outcome</h4>
									<p>My eyes were opened by the potential which Java has to build unique and creative applications.
										I learnt the key aspects of developing a program with Java and became very familiar with the manner 
										in which the language communicates with various classes through objects and methods.</p>
